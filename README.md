# ITCS6114_ComparisonBasedSortingAlgorithms
Implementation of insertion sort, merge sort, heap sort, quick sort with pivot, and median of 3 quick sort algorithms in C++ by comparing time complexity in sorting randomly initialized arrays of various sizes

This folder contains a visual studio solution of the project used to complete Project 1 for the course ITCS6114 at
UNCC. This folder contains all of the source code used including the required files for pbPlots.

The project requires no linkers and can be compiled using any ide with the header and source files in this folder.

When running the source.cpp file which contains main() the three .png files will be created which show the graphs
from each analysis. The raw times for each sorting algorithm is shown in the windows command prompt after compiling the
program.
